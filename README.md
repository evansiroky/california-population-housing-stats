# California Population and Housing Stats

A project to analyze demographic data to tell a story about California Housing supply relative to population.  Data obtained from here: http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/

View the combined data in the `combined-data.csv` file.  There are also some files called `ranked-*` that help quickly compare certain metrics of cities and counties across the state.  The `ranked-most-recent-year.csv` includes stats comparing population and housing growth for just the past year while `ranked-1990-2018.csv` includes stats for the entire duration of available data.
